# If you are new to snippets, coffeeScript or Cson:
Pay close attention to the indentation, cson files use indentation in place of brackets, to signify nesting within the object.
  if you alter the indentation, beyond what is expected behavior, it will not work.

Keep an eye on the format, you'll be building your own snippets and adding them to this file eventualy.
